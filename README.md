# Your approach to the assignment.

# Any additional tools or libraries

Using expo router, with react native reusables for tabs, although many components imported were not used

# Project Structure

The project was set up app router style, from expo router. \_layout defines the route, while index.ts is the base of the route, more information at expos documentation

# Future Steps

I think the quote should dissapear on scroll, as currently it takes too much space, cluttering the screen when scrolling, as not all the components can nicely fit on screen. Furthermore, for podcasts, quotes, or even blog posts, we could have AI generate them.

# Links/overview of work samples

1. https://github.com/Sectonic/HitchHikr at Uber Global hackathon, was a one of two team members, built a hitch hiking app, similar to uber. Didn't place but had a working prototpye.
2. https://github.com/Sectonic/CSYA-Hackathon-Submission at CSYA Hackathon, built a nutrition app, 2nd place in advanced track,

Both these apps are built on the same expo/react-native stack. These repos belong to my team mate, and I was a contributor.
